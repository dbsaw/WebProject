     The use of HTML, CSS and Javascript has a major impact in the maintainability of the website. 
        HTML acts as the backbone of the website, it organize and structures the content of the website. 
        CSS is a crucial component in web desvelopment that changes the way the website is created and styled. The visual appearance of the webpages is styled by using CSS. HTML, Javacript and CSS files are external from each other. That provides maintainability and makes the code accessible and easy to modify.
        Javscript is a essential part in the website creation. It makes the web pages interactive which improves the user's experience. It allows to make smooth animations and visual effects that makes the website more interesting for the user.
