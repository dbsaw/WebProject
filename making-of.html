    <h1 id="desgn">Website Desgin</h1> 
    <p id="pdq1">At the beginning of creating our website, we decided to implement a website that focuses on delivering healthy lifestyle resources to motivate and educate visitors. Red, black, and white were the main colors of the website. The choice of colors for the fitness website design is intentional to reflect the essence of the fitness and health theme. Red represents energy and excitement. White is chosen for its simplicity, clarity, and balance. Black adds a sense of elegance and strength to the design. The combination of red, white, and black provides contrast which improves the readability of the text and the visibility of essential elements of the website.  

The structure of the pages was built via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML contains the fundamental components to organize and present the content. For instance, each page has its own sections presented using div tags to enhance the visitor experience by making it easier to navigate and understand the information presented on the page. Along with classes and IDs that are used to uniquely identify or classify elements on a web page which helps easily apply styles using CSS. CSS plays a significant role in controlling the layout of pages. All styles applied using CSS were chosen carefully targeting the attraction of the visitors. JavaScript plays a crucial role in making web pages interactive, enhancing the overall visitor experience with smooth animations and visual effects. The separation of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files maintains a modular structure, fostering maintainability and facilitating easy code modification. This approach contributes to the accessibility and adaptability of our website.

        <h2>Home page</h2>
        <p>The design of the home page stands as a key factor, as it is the primary determinant for visitors to continue browsing and exploring or not. The header was designed to allow visitors to navigate between the website pages easily. It provides a visual response when visitors interact with the link elements using CSS, for instance, by highlighting the links when the visitor hovers. The same goes with the footer along with the necessary information to contact or inquire. The main content of the website presented a brief on the website, followed by the services we offer. At the end of the content, a register form is implemented by JavaScript where instant feedback is given to visitors while submitting the form to help them make quick corrections if needed. To move between the home page sections a scroll button is designed to make the scrolling experience more dynamic as the visitor prefers. </p>
