    <p id="pdq1">The design and the choice of colors for the website have a big impact on the delivered content. It made the pages aesthetically pleasing and easily navigable.
        The website has been carefully created to offer a unique and fascinating experience in every way. 
        The choice of colors plays an important role in the design of a webpage, such as attracting the attention of the user.
        The colors chosen for the website were chosen carefully, to symbolize the website and make it unique. We carefully considered the user's experience and prioritized creating a visually pleasing website by selecting the color palette thoughtfully, and the primary colors are red, black, and white. White to keep it plain and simple to use for the user, and the combination of red and black is to grab the attention of the user and keep excitement.
     The use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript has a major impact on the maintainability of the website. 
        HTML acts as the backbone of the website, it organizes and structures the content of the website. 
        CSS is a crucial component in web development that changes the way the website is created and styled. The visual appearance of the web pages is styled by using CSS. HTML, Javascript, and CSS files are external from each other. That provides maintainability and makes the code accessible and easy to modify.
        Javascript is an essential part of the website creation. It makes the web pages interactive which improves the user's experience. It allows to make smooth animations and visual effects that make the website more interesting for the user.
