        <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Our journey working on this website project was a big challenge for us. A challenging experience that helped
            us acquire many new skills, gain hands-on experience with working on front-end development and gave us the
            chance to be creative and collaborative. This reflective essay explores the journey of developing the
            website, list the encountered challenges we have faced and how we successfully overcame them. Also,
            discusses the lessons we learned along the way working in a team as well as the technical experience we
            gained.
        </p>
            <br><br>
             <h3>Our Steps</h3>
           <p>
            We followed multiple steps to bring <span id="webTitle">FitZone</span> to life. We began by analysing the requirements for the
            website. Then, we designed an eye-catching logo to instantly grab the attention of our website visitors.
            Also, we made sure to choose appropriate colours that reflect the idea of our website. For the planning
            phase, we divided the project work with each other making sure everyone gets fair piece of the work.
            Besides, we conducted regular weekly meetings to track the progress we have achieved and to share our
            thoughts and ideas.
            </p>

            <br><br>
           <h3>Challenges and how we overcame them</h3>
        <p>
            Finishing this project was not easy as we faced some challenges along the way. The first challenge we faced
            was handling the time pressure as we had to work on three projects simultaneously, which felt overwhelming,
            and took us time to adjust. Moreover, we were lacking some technical skills to implement all our ideas.
            Therefore, we dedicated time and effort to learn new skills and properties in html, CSS and JavaScript.
            Also, we developed troubleshooting and debugging skills that strengthen our problem-solving skills. 
            Debugging taught us how to analyse and locate the issues within our code and helped us adopt resilient
            and persistent mindset in overcoming technical challenges. 
            In addition, a major challenge was centralizing our work and to manage all our files in a one central place to
            keep all our files up to date without ending up with multiple conflicted files. As a result, we created a
            GitHub repository, where we became able to share our files and easily navigate through each other's work
            without ending up with multiple versions of the same work. In brief, these challenges taught us how to stay
            adaptable to overcome obstacles during the project.
            </p>

            <br><br>
       <h3>Skills we gained</h3>
           <p>
           Working on this project offered us the chance for growth, providing not only the chance to gain new
            technical skills regarding web development but also teamwork skills and values. Working as team taught us
            the important of having open communication within the group, which allowed us to share our thoughts and
            concerns with each other freely. Additionally, recognizing each team member's strengths and assigning tasks
            accordingly improved efficiency and overall project quality. Moreover, working on the project improved our
            problem-solving skills by presenting us with technical challenges. In sum, collaborative teamwork on this
            project contributed to the improvement of both our technical and teamwork skills.
        </p>
            <br><br>
        <p>
            In conclusion, working on this project has been a great experience that was more than just creating a
            website. The challenges we have faced, whether managing the time, aligning our visions, insufficient
            technical knowledge, taught us invaluable lessons. From the technical perspective, the project improved our
            web development skills. But more importantly, it emphasized the importance of teamwork, open communication
            and problem-solving in achieving accomplishing shared goals.
